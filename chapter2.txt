In JavaScript, variables are used to store data values. You can declare variables using three keywords: var, let, and const. Each has different scoping rules and usage.Add commentMore actions

in variable in can use "let" ex : let age = "26" 
if you want to modify it you can update it by age ="21"
but we should'nt use again let age ="27"

	•	Must begin with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($)
	•	Can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs
	•	Case-sensitive (myVar ≠ myvar)
	•	Cannot use reserved keywords (like let, class, return, etc.)
Ex:
let name = "Alice";
const country = "India";
var score = 100;

console.log(name, country, score);
