in this chapter we'll learn the difference between let,var,const!!Add commentMore actions

//var -
var a =65;
var b ="neha";
var c= null
var d= undefined

var is globally scoped it means it values can be changed.
for ex:
var b="krish"
it'll declare var b="krish"
 
 we won't be using var in js these days.

 so alternate in let ///

 const - 
 const isn't suppose to be changed . author uses this const because const cannot be changed.

 const should be initialzed before running the code.

 we should use const most of the time.
